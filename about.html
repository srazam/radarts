        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p> As Asian/American youth who have grown up and still live in NC, we both hope for this project to act as a pipeline to the movement for liberation 
            we wished we had been introduced to earlier. Hence, why this summer program is for Asian/American high schoolers (14-18) to help them build leadership 
            and organizing skills through art, in order to organize in our communities for racial, economic, and gender justice. We hope to provide a safe space for 
            all Asian/Asian American youth in North Carolina for them to learn from their peers as well as other community members. By providing educational workshops
            revolving around intersectional issues, current events, movement building, and using art, we hope to accomplish this goal.</p>
            
        <h3>Our Setup</h3>
            <p>The cohort will design a personal project for 2 months and will be celebrated with an exhibition/graduation at the end of the summer. Throughout the 
               program, there will be around four in-person/digital workshops with local artists and/or organizers, bi-monthly digital check-ins with each member of the 
               cohort, and 2-3 in-person social gatherings. All cohort members will receive a $100 stipend for their project in order to buy suppliles/any materials 
               necessary for their final art piece(s).</p>
