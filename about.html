        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>The RAD Arts program is a summer program for Asian/American high schoolers (14-18) to build leadership and organizing skills through art, 
            in order to organize in our communities for racial, economic, and gender justice. The cohort will design a personal project for 2 months 
            and will be celebrated with an exhibition/graduation at the end of the summer. Throughout the program, there will be around four in-person/digital 
            workshops with local artists and/or organizers, weekly digital check-ins with each member of the cohort, and 2-3 in-person social gatherings. All 
            cohort members will receive a $100+ stipend for their project.</p>
